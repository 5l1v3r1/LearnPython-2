How To Run
----------

Here is how to run the script against the IDB. If the program is a 64 bit program the extension is i64 and you have to use the 64 bit IDA to
disassemble it. The result of the script will be stored in the file log.txt. Every subsequent run will append to the file.

C:\IdaPythonExamples> idaw64 -A -L"log.txt" -Sidautils_examples.py testprogram.i64
