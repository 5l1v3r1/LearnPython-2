A loosely organized collection of Python code that I can refer to for finding out how to do things without having to google every time. Focus is
on writing code:

-- With the right style (PEP8)

-- Secure

-- Efficiently and using the right APIs

As I learn new concepts, I'll write little code snippets and explain their purpose as well as I can. This project will be a work-in-progress as long as I am interested in learning Python better.
